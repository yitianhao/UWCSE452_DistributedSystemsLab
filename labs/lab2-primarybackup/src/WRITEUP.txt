Lab 2 Writeup

Partner 1 Name, NetID: Yitian Hao
Partner 2 Name, NetID: Zheng Wang

Brief description of design:

ViewServer: just follow what described in the spec

PBClient: the basic structure of PBClient is similar to SimpleClint,
          except that we allow clients to communicate with ViewServer in the case
          A. initial startup; B. primary long time not replying

PBServer:

When a client request comes in...
if I think I am the primary and no state transferring, I can handle the request...
  if the incoming request is executed (arrive by delay), I will just return the stored result
  else if not there is a previous message being forwarding right now
    if not having a backup, I will process the request myself
    else send ForwardedRequest to my backup and set timer for it
I will wait until my backup ack me that the request has been done by it to execute the command and send back to client

When a server receives a new view...
If I know that it can be the case that either primary or backup dead
  as future primary I will begin state transfer,
  as future backup I will accept state transfer only if that is a new view for me
  as future primary I will update myView only if I know that this state transfer is completed
