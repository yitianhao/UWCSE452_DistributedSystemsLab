Brief description of design:


Union of hours spent on the lab:
Total time spent on the lab:

Terminology:
- multiple replica groups (each consists of a set of Paxos servers)
- one shard master (consists of a set of Paxos servers)

Part1: ShardMaster
Part2:
2.1 ShardStoreClient:
- get current ShardConfig to see which ReplicaGroup to send request
- send ShardStoreRequest and handle ShardStoreResponse

Two Applications: AMOApplication && ShardMaster

Design:
June 8
1. [slide p22] The number that SSClient and SSServer should query on (periodically) should not be -1,
   instead should be next possible configNum.
2. [slide p39] Update ShardMaster.join()

June 9
1. [NPE] add another condition to SSS.canServeAMOCommand()
2. [slide p38] Add in AMOApplication: Check if command.readOnly() and use app.executeReadOnly
3.

Questions for OH:
1. client skip first command
2. handle client request: difference configNum?? client's > server's server's > client's
3. test 4
4. test 5
