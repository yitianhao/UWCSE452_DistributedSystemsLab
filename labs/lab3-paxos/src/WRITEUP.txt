Lab 3 Writeup

Partner 1 Name, NetID: Yitian Hao, yh255
Partner 2 Name, NetID: Zheng Wang, zwang217

Brief description of design:



Union of hours spent on the lab: Yitian (38 hrs) + Zheng (29 hrs)
Total time spent on the lab: 67 hrs

Development timeline:
1. write inner/helper classes for Ballots and Log(s)
2. Accept messages/timers (P2As, P2Bs, Decisions)
  You can start by hard-coding one of the servers as the leader
  Make sure executions are happening in order (starting from slot_out and don’t skip slots) and progress can be made for clients

Previous updates:
1. [Andrew's OH] Set one timer for a message send (even though send this message to multiple servers)
2. [test14 log] handle the case that PaxosReply send failed
3. on timer resent should use previous ballot (i.e., the ballot recorded in the message), not current ballot
4. [ED https://edstem.org/us/courses/4921/discussion/437649] HeartbeatCheckTimer should be set at init for every server, reset when appropriate
5. [OH] If I think I am the leader and I found the incoming message contains a higher ballot, I am not leader anymore
6. [running --checks] Inner classes need @equals and @hashcode and optionally @toString (for debugging)
7. [test14 log] Only leader has the right to reset P2ATimer
8. [test14 log] when leader is settled, re-propose the accepted slots with own ballot
9. [test24 viz] Two types of mergeLog
       (P1B merge won’t decide no-op; leader merge ref. https://edstem.org/us/courses/4921/discussion/410869
10. [test24 viz] Decide when the leader is elected:
        add lastLeader (now leader is elected, followers should reset checker timer)
11. [test24 viz] Followers shouldn’t try to start leader election too early
        only when "roleSettled", can increase ballot
        P1A will use seqNum + address constructed ballot; rather than this.ballot(because this can be updated to higher ballot of another server during P1A)
12. [test18 log] Partitioned-out leader should know it is not leader any more if it didn't hear back HeartbeatReply for a long time.
13. Probably we don't need roleSettled variable?
14. [test23 viz] handleP2B should not accept message with old ballot (i.e., < current ballot)
15. [test11 https://edstem.org/us/courses/4921/discussion/429309] clear receivedLogs once merge is done
16. [test 18 all pass] Removed HeartbeatCheckReplyTimer since TA said so.
    handleP1A includes the case that the incoming leader's ballot is the same as the follower's. (This could happen if P1B gets dropped and leader resends P1A)

Timers:
P2ATimer: 1 timer ~ (n - 1) P2A send to other acceptors
P1ATimer: 1 timer ~ 1 P1A
HeartbeatTimer: 1 timer ~ (n - 1) Heartbeat send to other acceptors
HeartbeatCheckTimer: set in init, renew timer when a new leader is chosen
