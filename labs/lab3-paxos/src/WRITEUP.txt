Total time spent on the lab:

Development timeline:
1. write inner/helper classes for Ballots and Log(s)
2. Accept messages/timers (P2As, P2Bs, Decisions)
  You can start by hard-coding one of the servers as the leader
  Make sure executions are happening in order (starting from slot_out and don’t skip slots) and progress can be made for clients


1. Two types of mergeLog
       (P1B merge won’t decide no-op; leader merge ref. https://edstem.org/us/courses/4921/discussion/410869
2. Decide when the leader is elected:
        add lastLeader (now leader is elected, followers should reset checker timer)
3. Followers shouldn’t try to start leader election too early
        only when "roleSettled", can increase ballot
        P1A will use seqNum + address constructed ballot; rather than this.ballot(because this can be updated to higher ballot of another server during P1A)
